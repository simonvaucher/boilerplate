# Express + React + Webpack boilerplate

- Based on this tutorial: https://dev.to/kedar9/creating-a-node-app-with-react-webpack-4-babel-7-express-and-sass-3mae

### TL; DR;

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Visit [localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)

### Goal

- Fullstack example - from server to css

### Production / real world stuff

- Check `bin/deploy.sh`

### Nice to have

- User management
- DB usage
- Blog aggregator powered by server side
