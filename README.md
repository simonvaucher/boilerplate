# Express + React + Webpack boilerplate

- Based on this tutorial: https://dev.to/kedar9/creating-a-node-app-with-react-webpack-4-babel-7-express-and-sass-3mae

### TL; DR;

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Visit [localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)

## Goal

- Simple aggregator?

### Nice to have (not really needed in an aggregator...)

- User management
- DB usage
